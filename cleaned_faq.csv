Our community art project aims at nurturing peoples' empathy towards marine life, and raising funds to carry out urgent actions that can save our ocean. "
What is United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals?,"The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals designed to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the world. The SDGs were adopted by all United Nations Member States in September 2015 and aim to be achieved by the year 2030. Mindful Ocean Metaverse aims at building an active community to support UNSDG #14 - Life Below Water."
What is UNSDG #14 Life Below Water?,"""Life Below Water"" is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable practices related to the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources. This goal emphasizes the importance of conserving and sustainably using marine ecosystems and resources for the benefit of present and future generations."
Why should I care about the ocean?,"Caring about the ocean is essential because it sustains life on Earth. The ocean provides oxygen, regulates climate, and supports diverse marine species. It is a crucial source of food, jobs, and economic activities for millions. Preserving the ocean ensures a sustainable future, protects coastal communities from natural disasters, and promotes biodiversity. Our well-being and the planet's health depend on a thriving ocean."
What are the 3 core social missions of Mindful Ocean Metaverse?,"Our first social mission is to encourage more people to make art. We hope more people can value art-making and its benefits to mindfulness. Our second social mission is to explore the use of Web3 for social changes. We believe Web3 is not just about profits. The true value of Web3 is to empower social changes. Our third social mission is to support conservationists by cultivating empathy. We believe that through our art-making events and AR Metaverse, people can rethink and rebuild their relationships with marine life."
How can I participate as an artist?,"As an artist, you can take part in our NFT art creation events to raise funds for ocean conservation scientists and organizations to protect our ocean."
How can I participate as a collector?,"As a collector, you can collect the NFT arts in our community art events. Proceeds generated will be donated to ocean conservation scientists and organizations."
How can I participate as a scientist?,"As a scientist, you can participate as the beneficiaries of our community art events. Proceeds of each community art event can be dedicated to a partnered scientist's project. Also, partnered scientists can also benefit from the educational social content we create to raise awareness of their conservation projects."
How can I participate as an ocean conservation organization?,"We are looking for ocean conservation organizations to co-create educational content for ocean conservation, co-organize fund raising events, and collaborate in cross-promotion through our project."
How can I participate as an administrator of an educational institution?,"If you are an administrator of an educational institution, you can co-organize fund raising events with us to support ocean conservation in your institution. For example, we can collaborate with scientists and artisits to conduct virtual outreach with your students. Students can learn about the science of ocean conservation, explore how blockahin, AI, and AR technology can save marine life, and participate in art-making and fund-raising to solve a real-world problem. Part of the proceeds in an event can go to a reserve for your institution to carry out other sustainability education."
How can I participate as a parent?,"Our project is a great introduction for children to learn about how blockchain, AI, and AR technology can help us solve real-world problems. Parents can support their children to take part in our community art events that nurture mindfulness, empathy, and creativity. Moreover, your children's creative artworks can be digitized and preserved with the use of blockchain technology."
Is the blockchain technology we use environmental-friendly?,"Polygon (formerly Matic) is more environmentally friendly than traditional blockchains due to its use of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) systems, PoS doesn't rely on resource-intensive mining. Validators are chosen based on the tokens they hold and ""stake"" as collateral, eliminating the need for energy-consuming computations. This significantly reduces Polygon's energy consumption and carbon footprint, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly blockchain network."
What is NFT?,"NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Each NFT represents a specific item, artwork, music, video, or any digital content with proof of ownership and authenticity. NFTs use smart contracts to enable creators to monetize and sell their digital creations securely. Their uniqueness, scarcity, and ability to verify ownership make NFTs valuable for collectors and artists in the digital world."
How can blockchain technology facilitate ocean conservation?,"Blockchain technology can aid ocean conservation by enabling transparent and immutable data sharing. Decentralized blockchain platforms can record ocean-related data like water quality, marine biodiversity, and fishing practices securely and in real-time. This verifiable information allows stakeholders to monitor and address issues like illegal fishing, pollution, and climate change's impact on marine ecosystems. Additionally, blockchain-powered smart contracts can incentivize sustainable practices, encouraging responsible fishing and promoting eco-friendly tourism. Through transparent data and efficient transactions, blockchain can enhance collaboration among governments, NGOs, and communities, leading to effective ocean conservation efforts."
Why blockchain technology is used in this project?,We use blockchain as a means to raise funds for ocean conservation. It empowers anyone to turn their creative effort in our art-making events into actions that can contribute to protecting marine life.
How can AI technology facilitate ocean conservation?,"AI technology can enhance ocean conservation by analyzing vast amounts of ocean data quickly and accurately. AI algorithms can process data from satellite imagery, sensors, and underwater drones to monitor marine ecosystems, track species, and detect illegal activities like poaching or fishing in restricted areas. Machine learning models can predict patterns in ocean behavior, such as weather events and climate change impacts. This knowledge empowers conservationists and policymakers to make informed decisions and implement targeted measures to protect marine life, combat pollution, and promote sustainable practices, thus contributing to the preservation and health of our oceans."
Why AI technology is used in this project?,"We use AI to solve 3 problems. First, we use AI to allow users to interact with the simulated marine life in our app through their hand gestures. Second, AI enables us to determine the uniqueness of user-submitted artworks in our art-making events. We use AI to conduct image clustering to compute the Authentic Scarcity of an image among other images in an art-making event. Third, we use AI to facilitate content moderation to reduce the amount of inappropriate user-submitted content."
How can AR technology facilitate ocean conservation?,"AR (Augmented Reality) technology can facilitate ocean conservation by providing immersive and educational experiences for the public. AR apps can allow users to interact with virtual marine life and ecosystems, raising awareness about the importance of conservation. It enables real-time data visualization and overlays on physical surroundings, showcasing ocean health and pollution levels. AR can also aid researchers and conservationists in the field by providing instant access to data, maps, and marine life identification, making monitoring and data collection more efficient. By engaging people and professionals alike, AR technology can foster greater understanding and support for ocean conservation efforts."
Why AR technology is used in this project?,We use AR to provide an immersive experience for users to cultivate their empathy toward marine life. Our AR technology allows multiple users to interact with the simulated marine life authentically using their hands. 
What is Authentic Scarcity?,Authentic Scarcity is a score that represents the rarity of an artwork. It is computed with an AI algorithm that evaluates an artwork's uniqueness relative to all the other artworks in a community art event. 
What is a Cluster?,"For each artwork, our algorithm will categorize it into a Cluster based on the artwork's visual features. In other words, all artworks in a Cluster look similar."
What is a Supercluster?,"For each identified Cluster, our algorithm will further compare its overall visual characteristics with all the other Clusters. Clusters that look similar will be grouped into a Supercluster."
What is a Mint Pass?,"A Mint Pass refers to a digital pass or ticket issued using blockchain technology. It verifies the authenticity and ownership of digital assets like NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), granting access to exclusive events, content, or experiences. Mint Passes ensure secure and traceable access to unique digital items. A Mint Pass in our project is associated with a user-submitted artwork. Owning a Mint Pass allows you to redeem a Mindful Ocean NFT. "
What is a Mindful Ocean NFT?,"A Mindful Ocean NFT is a digital asset that has the following utilities. First, you can use it in the Metaverse Aquarium of our mobile app, which allows you to interact with the marine animal embedded in the NFT. Second, you can earn rewards from our partners via our airdrop events. Third, you can use the NFT as a ticket to attend to real-life ocean conservation event.
